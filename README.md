I have finished my first Javascript DOM assignment to build a fully functional Student Registration system with proper functionalities like editing and deleting certain data.
I have made the basic strcuture using HTML and later stylised it using CSS.
In the Javascript file, I have written the code to add all the required functionalities of the Student Registration method.
